"""Startup preflight: confirm the installed AIMU is new enough to run Kokua.

The ``aimu>=0.14.0`` requirement in ``pyproject.toml`` covers a normal install and nothing else. uv
installs a ``[tool.uv.sources]`` path source *without* checking it against the version specifier -- a
declared ``aimu>=0.99.0`` will happily install and lock a 0.13.1 sibling -- so in a development checkout
the pin is not a constraint on the AIMU actually running. This module is what enforces the floor there.

Left unchecked, an out-of-date sibling surfaces as an ``ImportError`` or a ``TypeError`` on some AIMU
call from deep inside the composition root: accurate, but it names a symbol rather than the fix.

Two checks, because neither alone is honest. The version floor catches an old checkout, including the
capabilities that are not importable symbols (AIMU 0.13.1 added the tool result to its web ``tool``
frame, which no ``getattr`` can detect). The capability probe catches an editable checkout whose
declared version already reads new enough while the code behind it predates the release -- the version
string of an editable install says what the branch claims, not what it contains.

The probe is a *signature* check rather than a name lookup, because the newest capability Kokua depends
on is a keyword argument: ``SkillManager(include=[...])``, which is how a worker's skills are scoped to
what its ``[agents.*]`` table declares. No ``getattr`` would notice its absence, and without it a worker
would silently receive every skill on disk instead of the ones it asked for.
