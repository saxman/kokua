"""Startup preflight: confirm the installed AIMU is new enough to run Kokua.

The ``aimu>=0.16.0`` requirement in ``pyproject.toml`` covers a normal install and nothing else. uv
installs a ``[tool.uv.sources]`` path source *without* checking it against the version specifier -- a
declared ``aimu>=0.99.0`` will happily install and lock a 0.13.1 sibling -- so in a development checkout
the pin is not a constraint on the AIMU actually running. This module is what enforces the floor there.

Left unchecked, an out-of-date sibling surfaces as an ``ImportError`` or a ``TypeError`` on some AIMU
call from deep inside the composition root: accurate, but it names a symbol rather than the fix.

Two checks, because neither alone is honest. The version floor catches an old checkout, including the
capabilities that are not importable symbols (AIMU 0.13.1 added the tool result to its web ``tool``
frame, which no ``getattr`` can detect). The capability probe catches an editable checkout whose
declared version already reads new enough while the code behind it predates the release -- the version
string of an editable install says what the branch claims, not what it contains.

The probe targets the newest surface Kokua depends on, which is all any older one needs: a checkout
carrying ``ContextOverflowError`` necessarily carries everything the releases before it added. It takes
whichever shape that surface has -- a name lookup for a symbol, or a signature check when the
capability is a keyword argument that no ``getattr`` would notice (as ``SkillManager(include=...)``
was, before this).
