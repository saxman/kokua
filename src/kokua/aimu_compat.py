"""Startup preflight: confirm the installed AIMU is new enough to run Kokua.

The ``aimu>=0.20.0`` requirement in ``pyproject.toml`` covers a normal install and nothing else. uv
installs a ``[tool.uv.sources]`` path source *without* checking it against the version specifier -- a
declared ``aimu>=0.99.0`` will happily install and lock a 0.13.1 sibling -- so in a development checkout
the pin is not a constraint on the AIMU actually running. This module is what enforces the floor there.

Left unchecked, an out-of-date sibling surfaces as an ``ImportError`` or a ``TypeError`` on some AIMU
call from deep inside the composition root: accurate, but it names a symbol rather than the fix.

Two checks, because neither alone is honest. The version floor catches an old checkout, including the
capabilities that are not importable symbols (AIMU 0.13.1 added the tool result to its web ``tool``
frame, which no ``getattr`` can detect). The capability probe catches an editable checkout whose
declared version already reads new enough while the code behind it predates the release -- the version
string of an editable install says what the branch claims, not what it contains.

The probe covers exactly one surface at a time: the newest one Kokua depends on, whose shape decides the
check's shape. A name lookup answers for a symbol; a membership check answers for an entry in a published
set whose mere existence proves nothing (``SUBAGENT_SPEC_KEYS`` shipped a release before the
``"generate_kwargs"`` entry Kokua came to depend on, so only its contents dated a checkout); a signature
check answers for a keyword argument no ``getattr`` would notice, which is the shape in force today and
was once before, when it was ``SkillManager(include=...)``. Checking one surface is no claim about the
others; covering those is the version floor's job.

A capability can also be shaped so that *nothing* can probe it, and AIMU 0.17.0's headline surface is:
the ``"thinking"`` key Kokua writes into an ``agent_types`` spec is a dict key, neither a symbol nor a
parameter, and an AIMU that predates it ignores it in silence rather than raising. What makes that
release probe-able anyway is the other half of it -- closing a spec's keys to a known set, published as
``SUBAGENT_SPEC_KEYS``, which is a symbol *and* is the set the key Kokua depends on belongs to. Where a
release offers no such handle, leave the probe where it is and say so here rather than moving it to
something it could only pretend to check.

AIMU 0.20.0 carries two capabilities Kokua depends on, and only the later one is worth probing. The
first is that a sub-agent spawned with a ``provider:model@base_url`` string reaches that endpoint: a
two-line fix inside a private function, adding no symbol, no parameter, and no set member, whose one
direct tell (which resolver that function reaches for) is exactly the sort of internal a later honest
refactor would change, turning this preflight into a wall in front of a *newer, working* AIMU. The
nearest handle on its path, ``endpoint_kwargs``, is what the probe gripped while that was the newest
surface, and its limit had to be stated out loud: the plumbing landed earlier *within* 0.20.0 than the
spawn fix riding on it, so a sibling parked between those two commits passed and still dropped a
sub-agent's endpoint.

The second capability closes that gap by arriving later in the same release with a handle of its own.
``SkillAgent`` builds its own skills server, so the ``env`` a host passes to ``build_skills_server``
cannot reach the entry agent's skill scripts; ``script_env`` is the constructor parameter that carries
the ``[email]`` settings and the downloads folder to them, and a checkout without it runs every one of
those scripts with the settings missing and no error anywhere. Probing it subsumes the older check
rather than trading one narrow window for another: it landed after both of the commits the endpoint
window sat between, so a sibling that passes this one has the spawn fix too. That is luck, not a rule.
The next surface may sit earlier than something else Kokua needs, and then its limit gets stated here
again.
